# BakedWithLove

Welcome to Baked With Love: a baking blog full of delicious, simple and pretty cake recipes. All the recipes that you will find on this site have been created and tested by me. I mainly bake with ground almonds, so the majority of my recipes are also gluten-free.

## Planning
### Target Audiences:
1. Home bakers & baking enthusiasts.
2. Users looking for easy-to-follow dessert recipes.
3. Users interested in baking gluten-free cakes and cupcakes.
4. Users looking for fun, kid-friendly recipes.

I used BeFunky.com to make my logo. Since, this is a recipe site and I do bake gingerbread biscuits, I though that a gingerbreadman was the perfect logo.

The wireframes that I have created were very simplified models of the site. I ended up adding a little gingerbread picture and the privacy policy to the footer as it did look very empty.

Colour Scheme
The 4 main colours that I used on all the pages were light pink, dark pink, gingerbread brown and white.
