Welcome to Baked With Love: a baking blog full of delicious, simple and pretty cake recipes. All the recipes that you will find on this site have been created and tested by me. I mainly bake with ground almonds, so the majority of my recipes are also gluten-free.

## Planning
### Target Audiences:
1. Home bakers & baking enthusiasts.
2. Users looking for easy-to-follow dessert recipes.
3. Users interested in baking gluten-free cakes and cupcakes.
4. Users looking for fun, kid-friendly recipes.

### Logo
I used BeFunky.com to make my logo. Since, this is a recipe site and I do bake gingerbread biscuits, I though that a gingerbreadman was the perfect logo.

### Wireframes
I used BeFunky to create a visual representation of the Baked With Love site - below are the initial idea designs:

Index Page Responsive Design

Recipes Page Responsive Design

About Page Responsive Design

Newsletter Page Responsive Design

The wireframes that I have created were very simplified models of the site. I ended up adding a little gingerbread picture, a copyright privacy policy to the footer as it did look very empty.

### Colour Scheme
The 4 main colours that I used on all the pages were light pink, dark pink, gingerbread brown and white. I wanted 2 light colours and 2 darker colours to create contrast.

## Future-Enhancements
1. Once I have more recipes, I would add a search bar next to my navigation bar. This would make it quicker for users to find a recipe that they interested in. If they type in a keyword like 'chocolate' all the chocolate cake recipes will appear.
2. Add a PrintFriendly button to all the recipes so that users are able to pint recipes without all the images and comments.
3. Optimize images for better site performance.
4. I would like to add a 'rate this recipe' button at the top of each recipe page. This will allow users to rate each recipe out of five stars.

## Testing Phase
The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

## Honourable mentions
Thank you to Komal Karir, my course tutor, who was always on hand whenever I had a question.

## General Reference
I relied upon W3schools and Youtube for general "how to's" throughout the project alongside course material from Code Institute.
