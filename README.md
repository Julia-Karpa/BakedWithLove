Welcome to Baked With Love: a baking blog full of delicious, simple and pretty cake recipes. All the recipes that you will find on this site have been created and tested by me. I mainly bake with ground almonds, so the majority of my recipes are also gluten-free.

## Planning
### Target Audiences:
1. Home bakers & baking enthusiasts.
2. Users looking for easy-to-follow dessert recipes.
3. Users interested in baking gluten-free cakes and cupcakes.
4. Users looking for fun, kid-friendly recipes.

### Aims of Site:
1. Connect with like-minded individuals who share a love for baking. My site has a comments section underneath each recipe where fellow bakers can exchange tips and ideas and suggest changes to the recipes.
2. Inspire people to bake.
3. Showcase cute, easy-to-follow and gluten-free recipes.


### Logo
I used BeFunky.com to make my logo. Since this is a recipe site and I do bake gingerbread biscuits, I thought that a gingerbread man was the perfect logo. When you click on the logo, you return to the homepage.

### Wireframes
I used BeFunky to create a visual representation of the Baked With Love site - below are the initial idea designs:

Index Page Responsive Design

Recipes Page Responsive Design

About Page Responsive Design

Newsletter Page Responsive Design

The wireframes that I created were very simplified models of the site layout. I did end up sticking to them as I felt like everything was spread out nicely. 

The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for Baked With Love. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. In the footer, there is also a link to the privacy policy since the site does collect personal information when users sign up for the newsletter or fill in the contact form.

### Colour Scheme
The 4 main colours that I used on all the pages were light pink, dark pink, gingerbread brown and white. I wanted 2 light colours and 2 darker colours to create contrast.



## Future-Enhancements
1. Once I have more recipes, I will add a search bar next to my navigation bar. This would make it quicker for users to find a recipe that they are interested in. If they type in a keyword like 'chocolate', all the chocolate cake recipes will appear.
2. Add a PrintFriendly button to all the recipes so that users are able to print recipes without all the images and comments. 
3. Optimize images for better site performance.
4. I would like to add a 'rate this recipe' button at the top of each recipe page. This will allow users to rate each recipe out of five stars.

## Testing Phase
The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

When I tested the html code for all of my pages I got the messages above. I learned that using an <a> tag to create a button that acts like a link is not semantically correct. I also used the h1 heading more than once on some pages as I wanted the font to be as large as possible. On the other hand, the CSS code was fine.

The most disappointing part of this project was seeing the page performance score. Although I did compress the photos, I still only ended up scoring 64 for performance. I took the photos with a professional camera, so the image sizes were very large to start with.

### Further Testing
The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge.
The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop and Android phones.
I also presented my website to classmates and received verbal feedback from them.

## Honourable mentions
Thank you to Komal Karir, my course tutor, who was always on hand whenever I had a question.

## General Reference
I relied upon W3schools and YouTube for general "how to's" throughout the project alongside course material from Code Institute.
